      <p>Hi. My name is Vyacheslav Kozlov and I'am a full-stack Ruby-on-rails developer.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Approach</h1>
      <h5>What do I want</h5>
      <p>My main goal is to translate business idea and business requirements into most suitable application architecture, that solves a real people's problems.</p>
      <h5>It is not all about programming</h5>
      <p>If you are a full stack developer, you need more than just a programming language. I need to have an eye for design, to know the basics of psychology, management, marketing and business logic. It allows me to keep the base idea and transform it into a web-service instead of making web app it's endpoint.</p>
      <p>I have marketing background and wide range of knowledges and interests that are adjacent to web-development, that you get out of the box.</p>

      <h1>Workflow</h1>
      <p>Here are some thoughts and principles I follow in my practice.</p>

      <h5>Quality over speed</h5>
      <p>Some things like working with programs, typing or similar should be speeded up.</p>

      <p>But thinking about how to make you code productive and secure or modeling should be done carefully. A mistake in the beginning of the programming has bigger price.</p>

      <h5>Modeling</h5>
      <p>Imposing order in developer's head is a keystone to make secure, correct and productive web application. It should be done as soon as possible. I compose clear and simple model to know what, when and how I can do a certain logic before I actually start doing it. Usually I use simple notebook and a pen. Sometimes I draw mindmaps.</p>

      <h5>My part</h5>
      <p>My role is to build a working project which based on existing base design mockup. And to add additional functions or maintain later if needed.</p>

      <h5>Using popular tools and decisions</h5>
      <p>I use most popular decisions while programming if possible. Popular decisions are well supported and documented. Also, new team members have no troubles working with them.</p>

      <h5>Design</h5>
      <p>I am not a designer and do not want to be. However, there are situations, when there no pre-existing mock-ups available. I can easily continue the existing design's guideline and build my own if it is needed. I like clear and simple design layouts that help to bring the idea of the app in more fast and efficient way.</p>

      <h5>Remote work</h5>
      <p>I believe, that there is no difference where you work from. If you love what you do, you don't need to be managed or punched by someone to do what you do. I found myself very happy in programming and having pleasure from it nowaydays.</p>

      <h5>Think</h5>
      <p>There are good things and bad things. Good things are those which are thought about. First think, then implement - it's a really good practice.</p>

      <h5>Testing</h5>
      <p>Test coverage is the best thing that can happen in a life of every application. I use TDD & BDD or some sort of testing for almost every app.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h1>Why ruby on rails?</h1>
      <p>It's an ideal choice for startup. For prototyping, for quick launches of web services and in a situation, when you decide, that you need to make a step beyond the plan and lead your application to another targets.</p>
      <p>Rails community is wide, professional and active. And that's what it means for you:</p>
      <p class="reason">1) You will get you app faster.</p>
      <p class="explanation">there are many ready-to-go decisions that can be quickly implemented. It will allow to significantly increase a speed of development without loosing it's quality.</p>
      <p class="reason">2) Your will get safe and productive app.</p>
      <p class="explanation">all these decisions are used and tested by thousands of developers. So they are on a top of technologies, they are secure and up to dated.</p>
      <p class="reason">3) It will save you investments.</p>
      <p class="explanation">rails has many conventions on how to write code and to store it. It means that new team member wouldn't need a weeks to understand what is code about and would be able to make some meaningful commits to a code at the first day of his work. It also means that transferring the web app from one developer to another is easy.</p>
      <p>By the way, these services are written on Ruby-on-Rails: <span class="bold">Twitter, Shopify, GitHub, BaseCamp, Campfire, SlideShare, Groupon, Tumblr, Posterious, Blogger, AirBnB, Indiegogo, CrunchBase, Bloomberg, Bleacher Report and Square.</span></p>
      <p>So, you will be in a good company.</p>

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>There are some factors and premises that brought me to programming.</p>
      <p>I am a system-thinker and I always loved to deduce a system from some chaotic process, and then to think about how to increase it's efficiency. I systemized almost anything - ideas, information, life, concepts.</p>
      <p>Also I always had many ideas. I was writing verses, inventing business ideas and decisions. It leaded me to marketing education in Russian Economic Academy of Plechanov which have top-rated marketing facultee in Russia and then to PhD course.</p>
      <p>I always loved computers. Started using computers in 2nd grade of school. Till the moment, when there were 5-inch diskettes, MS-Dos, IBM i486, Total Commander and later Windows 3.11. I tried all of these and even more.</p>
      <p>In fact, I started doing sites more than 10 years ago. At first there were simple html sites for myself. Later they got some php-programming and javascript. And 5 years ago I find myself happy in programming on Ruby-on-Rails. Since then I spend a big part of my life developing web applications.</p>
      <p>I think programming is a great tool for bringing great ideas to life. 1 piece of exertion can be transformed into 1000 pieces of result. A simple site or service being developed in 1 month could change lives of 1000's tomorrow. It allows to solve global problems.</p>

      <h1>Life</h1>
      <p>My life is definitely not all about programming. I like to read books, do Tai-Chi, go to mountains and read philosophical and esoteric literature. I dedicated some part of my life to photography and last year tried myself in filmmaking.</p>
      <p>But computers always were my passion and programming is a way to exercising my own ideas and to help in exercising yours.</p>
