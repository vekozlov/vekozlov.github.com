<p>You will get not just a freelancer, but a team-member, who is interested in your project and share your idea (I will not take the project otherwise). I ask questions, deeg into your business to deliver ideas, thoughts and better development decisions.</p>


<p>My main goal is to translate business idea and business requirements into most suitable application architecture, that solves real people's problem.</p>

<p>If you are a full stack developer, you need more than one programming language. I need to have an eye for design, to know the basics of psychology, management, marketing and business logic. It allow me to keep the base idea and transform it into a web-service instead of making web app it's endpoint. I have marketing background and wide range of adjacent knowledges and interests, that you get out of the box.</p> -->

            <p>The only way for journalist to tell truth is be independent. Uncoverage is a crowdfunding platform, that helps to make journalist investigations that really matters. Journalists involved to a project are independent journalists with a huge background in such publications as New York Times, The Guardian etc.</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>There are some factors and premises that brought me to programming.</p>
        <p>I am a system-thinker and I always loved to deduce a system from some chaotic process, and then to think about how to increase its efficiency. I systemized almost anything - ideas, information, life, concepts.</p>
        <p>I’am the one who was always asked to «reinstall windows» :). Started to use computers when there were 5-inch diskettes, MS-Dos, IBM i486, Total Commander and later Windows 3.11. I tried all of these and even more.</p>
        <p>I started doing sites more than 18 years ago. At first there were simple html sites for myself. Later they got some php-programming and javascript. And 6 years ago I find myself happy in professional programming. Since then I spend a big part of my life developing web applications and helping people to bring their ideas to life.</p>
        <p>I think programming is a great tool for doing that. 1 piece of exertion can be transformed into 1000 pieces of result. A simple site or service being developed in 1 month could change lives of 1000's tomorrow. It allows to solve global problems.</p>
        <p>Besides programming I like fantasy books, classical cinema, Tai-Chi and Qi Gong, travelling and hiking in the mountains.</p>
