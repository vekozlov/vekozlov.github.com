      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>There are some factors and premises that brought me to programming.</p>
      <p>I am a system-thinker and I always loved to deduce a system from some chaotic process, and then to think about how to increase its efficiency. I systemized almost anything - ideas, information, life, concepts.</p>
      <p>I’am the one who was always asked to «reinstall windows» :). Started to use computers when there were 5-inch diskettes, MS-Dos, IBM i486, Total Commander and later Windows 3.11. I tried all of these and even more.</p>
      <p>I started doing sites more than 18 years ago. At first there were simple html sites for myself. Later they got some php-programming and javascript. And 6 years ago I find myself happy in professional programming. Since then I spend a big part of my life developing web applications and helping people to bring their ideas to life.</p>
      <p>I think programming is a great tool for doing that. 1 piece of exertion can be transformed into 1000 pieces of result. A simple site or service being developed in 1 month could change lives of 1000's tomorrow. It allows to solve global problems.</p>
      <p>Besides programming I like fantasy books, classical cinema, Tai-Chi, travelling and hiking in the mountains.</p>
