      <p>Hi. My name is Vyacheslav Kozlov and I'am a full-stack Ruby-on-rails developer.</p>
      <!-- <div class="devider">&#8230;</div> -->

      <h1>Approach</h1>
      <h5>What do I want</h5>
      <p>My main goal is to translate business idea and business requirements into most suitable application architecture, that solves real people's problem.</p>
      <h5>It is not all about programming</h5>
      <p>If you are a full stack developer, you need more than one programming language. I need to have an eye for design, to know the basics of psychology, management, marketing and business logic. It'll allow me to keep the base idea and transform it into a web-service instead of making web app it's endpoint.</p>
      <p>I have marketing background and wide range of adjacent knowledges and interests, that you get out of the box.</p>

      <h1>My stack of technologies</h1>
      <p>I can do both backend and frontend. From building a webapp from scratch to writing all javascript/css logic of a project.</p>
      <p>Here are some technologies that I used most.</p>

      <h5>Front end</h5>
      <p>JS. Jquery. Coffeescript. Backbone. Marionette.</p>
      <p>CSS. Sass.</p>
      <p>Html. Haml. Not a big fan of haml/slim when it comes to templates, though. For me, html syntax is simple-enough and quite readable.</p>

      <h5>Backend</h5>
      <p>Rails-stack. Ruby. RVM. RubyGems (rails, devise, nokogiri, omniauth, rspec, cucumber and more…)</p>
      <p>Heroku. Amazon. Locum.</p>
      <p>Rspec. Cucumber. Test coverage is the best thing that can happen in a life of every application. I use TDD & BDD or some sort of testing for almost every app.</p>
      <p>DB. Mongo. Postgres.</p>
      <p>Git. Github.</p>
      <p>Ubuntu. Mac Os X. Terminal. Terminal programs and some bash scripting.</p>

      <h1>Workflow</h1>
      <p>Here are some thoughts and principles I follow in my practice.</p>

      <h5>Quality over speed</h5>
      <p>Some things like working with programs, typing or similar should be speeded up.</p>

      <p>But thinking about how to make you code productive and secure or modeling should be done carefully. A mistake in the beginning of the programming have bigger price.</p>

      <h5>Modeling</h5>
      <p>Imposing order in developer's head is a keystone to make secure, correct and productive web application. It should be done as soon as possible. I compose clear and simple model to know what, when and how I can do a certain logic before I actually start doing it. Usually I use simple notebook and a pen. Sometimes I draw mindmaps.</p>

      <h5>My part</h5>
      <p>My role is to build a working project which based on existing base design mockup. And to add additional functions later if needed. Sometimes it involve only programming, sometimes with continuing a design guideline.</p>

      <h5>Using popular tools and decisions</h5>
      <p>I use most popular decisions while programming if possible. Popular decisions are well supported and documented. Also, new team members have no troubles working with them.</p>

      <h5>Design</h5>
      <p>I am not a designer and do not want to be. However, there are situations, when there no pre-existing mock-ups available. I can easily continue the existing design's guideline and build my own if it is needed. I like clear and simple design layouts that help to bring the idea of the app in more fast and efficient way.</p>

      <h5>Remote work</h5>
      <p>I believe, that there is no difference where you work from. If you love what you do, you don't need to be managed or punched by someone to do what you do. I found myself very happy in programming and having pleasure from it.</p>

      <h5>Think</h5>
      <p>There are good things and bad things. Good things are those which are thought about. First think, then implement.</p>

      <h5>Real problem</h5>
      <p>I think web app should resolve real people problems. Fake problem leads to fake demand.</p>

      <h1>Why ruby on rails?</h1>
      <p>It's an ideal choice for startup. For prototyping, for quick launches of web services and in a situation, when you decide, that you need to make a step beyond the plan and lead your application to another targets.</p>
      <p>Rails community is wide, professional and active. And that's what it means:</p>
      <p>1) there are many ready-to-go decisions that can be quickly implemented. It will allow to significantly increase a speed of development without loosing it's quality.
      <p>2) all these decisions are used and tested by thousands of developers. So they are on a top of technologies, they are secure and up to dated.</p>
      <p>3) rails has many conventions on how to write code and to store it. It means that new team member wouldn't need a weeks to understand what is code about and would be able to make some meaningful commits to a code at the first day of his work. It also means that transferring the web app from one developer to another is easy.</p>
      <p>By the way, these services are written on Ruby-on-Rails: Twitter, Shopify, GitHub, BaseCamp, Campfire, SlideShare, Groupon,Tumblr, Posterious, Blogger, AirBnB, Indiegogo, CrunchBase, Bloomberg, Bleacher Report and Square.</p>
      <p>So, you will be in a good company.</p>

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I am a system-thinker. I always loved to deduce a system from some chaotic process, and then to think about how to increase it's efficiency. I systemized almost anything - ideas, information, life.</p>
      <p>Also I had many ideas. I was writing verses, inventing some life hacks and business ideas. It leaded me to marketing education.</p>
      <p>And, funally, I started using computers in 2nd grade of school. Till the moment, when there were 5-inch diskettes, MS-Dos, IBM i486, Total Commander and later Windows 3.11. I tried all of these and even more.</p>
      <p>These factors brought me to programming.</p>
      <p>In fact, I started doing sites more than 10 years ago. At first there were simple html sites for myself. Later they got some php-programming and javascript. And 5 years ago I find myself happy in programming on Ruby-on-Rails. Since then I spend a big part of my life developing web applications.</p>
      <p>I think programming is a great tool for bringing great ideas to life. 1 piece of exertion can be transformed into 1000 pieces of result. A simple site or service being developed in 1 month could change lives of 1000's tomorrow. It allows to solve global problems.</p>

      <h1>Life</h1>
      <p>My life is definitely not all about programming. I like reading books, doing Tai-Chi, going to mountains. I dedicated some part of my life to photography and last year tried myself in filmmaking.</p>
      <p>But programming is a way to exercising my ideas and to help in exercising yours.</p>
