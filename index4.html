      <h1>Approach</h1>
      <p>Here are some thoughts and principles I follow in my practice.</p>
      <h5>My part </h5>
      <p>My role is to build a working project from scratch or continue app development, that reflecting initial idea on it’s maximum. And to add additional features or support it later if it’s needed.</p>
      <p>I can work independently, be a part of a team or lead 1-2 developers.</p>
      <h5>Communications</h5>
      <p>I have experience in communications with clients (after finishing university I was working in a leading advertising agency as a project manager and also I have experience in communications with clients as an independent developer). I can easilly communicate with people without tech background and explain them something with simple words.</p>
      <h5>Design</h5>
      <p>I am not a designer (and do not want to be). However, there are situations, when there no pre-existing mock-ups available. I can easily continue the existing design's guideline and build my own if it is needed. I like clear and simple design layouts that help to bring the idea of the app in more fast and efficient way.</p>

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>My life is definitely not all about programming. I like to read books, do Tai-Chi, go to mountains and read philosophical and esoteric literature . I dedicated some part of my life to photography and last year tried myself in filmmaking. But computers always were my passion and programming is a way to exercising my own ideas and to help in exercising yours.</p>
      <p>There are some factors and premises that brought me to programming.</p>
      <p>I am a system-thinker and I always loved to deduce a system from some chaotic process, and then to think about how to increase it's efficiency. I systemized almost anything - ideas, information, life, concepts.</p>
      <p>Also I always had many ideas. I was writing verses, inventing business ideas and decisions. It leaded me to marketing education in Russian Economic Academy of Plechanov which have top-rated marketing facultee in Russia and then to PhD course.</p>
      <p>I always loved computers. Started using computers in 2nd grade of school. Till the moment, when there were 5-inch diskettes, MS-Dos, IBM i486, Total Commander and later Windows 3.11. I tried all of these and even more.</p>
      <p>In fact, I started doing sites more than 15 years ago. At first there were simple html sites for myself. Later they got some php-programming and javascript. And 6 years ago I find myself happy in programming on Ruby-on-Rails. Since then I spend a big part of my life developing web applications.</p>
      <p>I think programming is a great tool for bringing great ideas to life. 1 piece of exertion can be transformed into 1000 pieces of result. A simple site or service being developed in 1 month could change lives of 1000's tomorrow. It allows to solve global problems.</p>

      <h1>Workflow</h1>
      <p>Here are some thoughts and principles I follow in my practice.</p>

      <h5>Quality over speed</h5>
      <p>Some things like working with programs, typing or similar should be speeded up.</p>

      <p>But thinking about how to make you code productive and secure or modeling should be done carefully. A mistake in the beginning of the programming has bigger price.</p>

      <h5>Modeling</h5>
      <p>Imposing order in developer's head is a keystone to make secure, correct and productive web application. It should be done as soon as possible. I compose clear and simple model to know what, when and how I can do a certain logic before I actually start doing it. Usually I use simple notebook and a pen. Sometimes I draw mindmaps.</p>

      <h5>My part</h5>
      <p>My role is to build a working project which based on existing base design mockup. And to add additional functions or maintain later if needed.</p>

      <h5>Using popular tools and decisions</h5>
      <p>I use most popular decisions while programming if possible. Popular decisions are well supported and documented. Also, new team members have no troubles working with them.</p>

      <h5>Design</h5>
      <p>I am not a designer and do not want to be. However, there are situations, when there no pre-existing mock-ups available. I can easily continue the existing design's guideline and build my own if it is needed. I like clear and simple design layouts that help to bring the idea of the app in more fast and efficient way.</p>

      <h5>Remote work</h5>
      <p>I believe, that there is no difference where you work from. If you love what you do, you don't need to be managed or punched by someone to do what you do. I found myself very happy in programming and having pleasure from it nowaydays.</p>

      <h5>Think</h5>
      <p>There are good things and bad things. Good things are those which are thought about. First think, then implement - it's a really good practice.</p>

      <h5>Testing</h5>
      <p>Test coverage is the best thing that can happen in a life of every application. I use TDD & BDD or some sort of testing for almost every app.</p>
